# Fleet-Track-Cloud-Based-Fleet-Management-Platform
## üìò Overview  
**Fleet Track** is a cloud-based fleet management system that enables real-time tracking, monitoring, and performance analytics of vehicles in a distributed environment.  
It integrates data from the **CARLA Simulator**, processes it through a **Flask backend**, and visualizes live results through a user-friendly **GUI dashboard**.  
This project highlights advanced concepts in **Programming**, **Cloud integration**, and **Data visualization** to simulate and manage 1000+ vehicles efficiently.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Features  
**Real-Time Vehicle Telemetry** ‚Äì Capture live vehicle metrics like speed, route, and fuel consumption via CARLA Simulator.   
**Cloud-Hosted Backend** ‚Äì Flask API backend handles routing, concurrency, and live data streaming.   
**Dual Database Integration** ‚Äì Combines **MySQL** (for structured trip data) and **MongoDB** (for telemetry and logs).   
**Dynamic GUI Dashboard** ‚Äì Visualize live fleet analytics, performance, and health monitoring.   
**User Management System** ‚Äì Secure login and access control.
